#Introduction
The Hangman game is a word guessing game where the player has to guess a word by suggesting letters within a certain number of attempts. The game is played between the computer and one human player. The computer selects a word from a list of words, and the player has to guess the word by suggesting letters. The player has a limited number of attempts to guess the word. If the player guesses the word within the given number of attempts, they win. Otherwise, they lose.

#Description
Here is a brief description of the Hangman game code in Python:
The code uses the `random` module to select a random word from a list of words. The `hang_man_word_list` module contains a list of words that can be used in the game. The `random_words` function selects a random word from the list.

The `hang_man_art` module contains the ASCII art for the hangman. The `HANGMAN` variable in the module contains the ASCII art for the hangman.

The `accept_guess` function accepts a guess from the user and checks if it is valid. If the guess is valid, the `checking_guess` function is called.

The `checking_guess` function checks if the guessed letter is in the chosen word. If the letter is in the word, it replaces the corresponding underscore in the `found_letters` list with the guessed letter. If the guessed word is the same as the chosen word, the user wins. Otherwise, the `accept_guess` function is called again.

If the guessed letter is not in the chosen word, the `attempts` counter is incremented, and the `hanging` function is called.

The `hanging` function prints the hangman art based on the number of attempts. If the user has used up all their attempts, the game ends, and the user loses.

You can customize the game by changing the variables in the code.
